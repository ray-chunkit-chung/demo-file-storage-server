To create a simple file storage server with a command line interface, you could follow these steps:

1. Choose a programming language and select the appropriate libraries for file management and command line interface.

2. Implement a server that listens for client requests and provides basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for files stored on the server.

3. Create a command line interface that communicates with the server using the appropriate protocol (e.g., HTTP or FTP) and allows users to perform operations such as uploading, downloading, and deleting files.

4. Store the files on the server's file system in a well-organized manner, with appropriate permissions and backup mechanisms in place.

5. Test the file storage server thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and is secure.

Some popular programming languages for creating file storage servers include Python, Java, and Ruby. The choice of language and libraries will depend on your specific requirements and constraints.
